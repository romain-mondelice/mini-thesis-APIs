# mini-thesis-APIs
Research paper : Digital transformation of organisations : APIs and how to use them

APIs are a flexible and lightweight approach that can be used by an enterprise to provide software
programming functionality to internal and third-party applications.
The goal of this research paper is to provide the keys to determine which API usage method is best suited
for a given situation.
To do this, a reminder of the scope of the dissertation will be provided. Then, the main terms that will be
used throughout the brief will be defined. Once the scope and definitions are acquired, it will be possible to
highlight the specifications and technical workings of the different methods of using an API. After this part, the
reader will already know which method of use is the most appropriate for his situation. He will then be able to
define the maturity level of the API he will develop with the help of the section on maturity models.
The rest of the thesis brings a more global vision. There is a section on the adoption of APIs. Then, a part
concerning CA-GIP (Crédit Agricole Group Infrastructure Platform) will be available. The reader will learn about
the impact of the digital transition on the organization and the methods of using APIs that are put in place.

At the end of this document, one will find a summary and a conclusion that includes usage tips for CA-
GIP (Crédit Agricole Group Infrastructure Platform) resulting from the analysis performed during the elaboration 
of this research paper.
